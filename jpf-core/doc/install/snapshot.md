# Downloading Binary Snapshots #


Available binary snapshots are attached as *.zip archives to the [jpf-core](../jpf-core/index) page. Just click the on the download link and tell your browser where to store them on disk, which you need to remember for your subsequent [site.properties](../install/site-properties) configuration. We recommend putting all JPF modules under a single parent directory that holds the site.properties file:

~~~~~~~~ {.bash}
jpf/
     site.properties
     jpf-core/
     jpf-symbc/
     â€¦
~~~~~~~~

Many JPF modules are still fast moving, so we recommend using the source repositories to stay up-to-date. Our policy is to only push changes to this server which pass all regression tests
